\section{Summary}

I have made software for the CRIMI, a Fourier transform spectrometer. This is a stand-alone program which works with the step-integrate method: each step of the stage is followed by dwell time and a measurement, after which another step is taken. The acquired data is processed with a Hann apodization function and fast Fourier transformed. Both the raw and the processed data are saved in \verb!csv! files. Some work has been done involving a fast scan method, however, most of this remains future work.
